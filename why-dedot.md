# Why Dedot?

The idea of building Dedot was conceived & motivated from our frustration of building Dapps in the Polkadot ecosystem using @polkadot/api (pjs). @polkadot/api is a good library and was built by the great minds behind it. But over the years, its limitations havenâ€™t been addressed yet, and this hinders developers from creating optimal Dapps for the Polkadot ecosystem and makes it really hard to onboard new developers to the ecosystem.

### Limitations of Polkadot.js API (@polkadot/api)

1. Large bundle-size (`wasm` & `bn.js` & unused type defs)
2. High memory consumption
3. Limitations in Types & APIs suggestions for individual chains

### Dedot comes to address those issues

1. Small bundle-size and tree-shakable
2. Less memory consumption
3. Types & APIs suggestion/auto-complete for individual Substrate-based chains

### Dedot also comes with more & more features

1. Native TypeScript type system for scale-codec
2. Adopted latest changes in metadata V14 & V15
3. Build on top of new JSON-RPC specs (and the legacy as well but deprecated soon)
4. Support light clients (smoldot)
5. Typed Contract APIs
6. Fully typed low level JSON-RPC client
7. A builtin mechanism to cache metadata
8. Compact Metadata ðŸ”œ
9. XCM utilities ðŸ”œ
10. React Native supports ðŸ”œ

... and a lot more toolings around Dedot to come
